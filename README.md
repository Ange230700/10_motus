<!-- README.md -->

Below is a detailed list of issues and potential problems with the provided code, both in terms of logic and implementation:

1. **Case Sensitivity Not Addressed**  
   The comment `// TODO: fix jeu sensible à la casse.` indicates that the code should handle case-insensitivity, but it never actually does. If the base word is `"dictionnaire"` and the user inputs `"Dictionnaire"`, it won't count as correct. A solution would be to convert both `word` and `base` to lowercase before comparison and analysis.

2. **Inconsistent Return Types From `tryWord`**  
   If `word === base`, the function `tryWord` returns `true`. In all other cases, it returns an object containing `wellPlaced`, `missplaced`, and `notInWord`. This inconsistency causes issues later when the calling code tries to access `result.wellPlaced` on a boolean value. Ideally, `tryWord` should return a consistent object structure each time, or the caller should handle the case where the result is just a boolean.

3. **Incorrect Loop Condition**  
   The `for` loop in `tryWord` uses `for (let i = 0; i < arrayBase.length-1; i++)`, which iterates only up to `arrayBase.length - 2`. This means the last character of the `base` word is never checked. It should likely be `for (let i = 0; i < arrayBase.length; i++)`.

4. **Misclassification of Letters (Logic Errors)**  
   The logic for categorizing letters into `wellPlaced`, `missplaced`, and `notInWord` is flawed:

   - **Well Placed:**  
     This is handled by checking if `arrayBase[i] === arrayWord[i]`. If true, the letter is well placed. That part is straightforward.

   - **Missplaced:**  
     Currently, the code treats **any character that isn't well placed as "missplaced"** by default:

     ```js
     else {
       missplaced.push(arrayWord[i])
     }
     ```

     This is incorrect. A character is "missplaced" only if it exists **somewhere else** in the `base` word. Just because it's not well placed doesn't mean it's in the wrong spot—maybe it doesn't belong in the word at all.

   - **Not In Word:**  
     The code determines `notInWord` by checking if `arrayBase.includes(char) === false` after the loop. However, this is too late and not integrated with the rest of the logic. Some letters marked as "missplaced" might actually not be in the word at all. As a result, a character can end up being counted as both "missplaced" and "notInWord."

   In short, the code needs a more careful approach:

   - First, identify well-placed letters and remove them from consideration.
   - Then identify letters that appear in the word but in different positions.
   - Finally, any remaining unmatched letters are not in the word.

5. **Duplicates Handling Not Implemented**  
   Consider the base word `"dictionnaire"` and a guess like `"iiiiiiiiiii"`. The code doesn't handle multiple occurrences correctly. It does not keep track of how many times a letter appears in the base word and how many have already been accounted for. Proper "missplaced" logic typically involves counting letter occurrences.

6. **Inconsistent Data Handling**  
   The `missplaced` and `notInWord` arrays are determined in a way that can overlap or contradict each other. For instance, a letter that doesn't appear in the base word at all might first be pushed into `missplaced` and then later identified as `notInWord`. In a proper solution, you should classify each letter only once.

7. **No Length Checks or Validation**  
   The code doesn't handle cases where `word` and `base` have different lengths. For a word-guessing game, typically the guess should be the same length as the base word, or you should handle that scenario gracefully.

8. **Hardcoded `base` Word Inside `guess` Function**  
   While not a direct error, it's a design issue. The `base` word is hard-coded inside `guess()` rather than being configurable or passed as a parameter. This makes the code less flexible if you want to easily change the word or handle multiple rounds.

9. **Potential DOM Errors If `tryWord` Returns `true`**  
   When the guess is correct, `tryWord` returns `true`. The calling code does this:

   ```js
   document.getElementById("well").innerText =
     "Bien placé: " + result.wellPlaced.join(", ");
   ```

   But if `result` is `true`, `result.wellPlaced` does not exist, causing a runtime error.

   A solution is to return a uniform response structure or handle the winning condition before trying to access `result.wellPlaced`.

10. **Naming Conventions and Clarity**  
    The code uses `missplaced` instead of `misplaced`. This is a minor linguistic nitpick, but it's good practice to keep naming consistent and correct (e.g. `misplaced`).

**Summary of Needed Fixes:**

- Convert both `base` and `word` to lowercase before comparisons (to address case sensitivity).
- Return a consistent data structure from `tryWord` or handle the winning condition separately.
- Correct the for loop boundary to iterate over the entire word.
- Redo the logic to correctly identify well-placed, misplaced, and not-in-word letters, taking into account letter frequencies and properly excluding letters as they are matched.
- Handle the scenario where the guess is exactly the base word more cleanly to avoid `null` or `undefined` references.
- Optionally, improve code organization, naming, and flexibility (e.g., passing `base` as a parameter instead of hardcoding it).

# After refactoring the code

**Overall Structure and Flow:**

1. **Entry Point (index.html & main.js):**

   - The `index.html` file sets up a basic HTML page structure and includes:

     - A `div#app` placeholder where the entire app will be injected dynamically.
     - A `script` tag that imports `main.js` as a module.

   - The `main.js` script imports the `waitForDOMContentLoading` function from `listeners.js` and executes it, effectively starting the application when the DOM is ready.

2. **Events and Handlers (listeners.js & handlers.js):**

   - `listeners.js` defines functions to attach event listeners:

     - On `DOMContentLoaded`, it calls `handleDOMContentLoading`.
     - After the DOM is loaded and the UI is set, it attaches a click event listener to the "Try" button, calling `handleWordSubmission`.

   - `handlers.js` defines the actual functions that respond to events:
     - `handleDOMContentLoading()` sets up the initial HTML content (via `setAppHtmlContent()`) and then calls `waitForWordSubmission()` to attach the click listener.
     - `handleWordSubmission()` calls `guess()`, which performs the logic to compare the user's guess with the target word.

3. **DOM Manipulation (manipulation.js):**

   - `setAppHtmlContent()` injects the main UI structure (returned by `createApp()`) into `#app`.
   - `guess()` performs the main logic:
     - Fetches the user input from `#word-to-check`.
     - Calls `tryWord()` to analyze the guess against the secret word (`"dictionnaire"`).
     - If the guess is correct, it updates the `#verdict` to "You won!".
     - Regardless of correctness, it updates the UI to show:
       - The tried word.
       - Letters well placed.
       - Misplaced letters.
       - Letters not in the word.
       - Resets the input field for a new guess.

4. **Logic and Utilities (utilities.js):**

   - `checkIfUserHasFoundRightWord()`:
     - Checks if the submitted word matches the target word in length and characters (case-insensitive).
   - `tryWord()`:
     - If the guess is correct, returns all letters as "well placed".
     - If not correct, it:
       - Splits both guessed word and target word into arrays of letters.
       - Identifies well-placed letters (correct letter in the correct position).
       - Identifies misplaced letters (letters that exist in the word but are not in the right position).
       - Identifies letters not in the word.
     - Returns an object containing three arrays:
       - `arrayOfLettersPlacedInRightSpot`
       - `arrayOfMisplacedLetters`
       - `arrayOfLettersNotInWordToGuess`

   **Potential Issues in the Logic:**

   - **Handling Multiple Occurrences of the Same Letter:**  
     The logic for identifying misplaced letters could be problematic for words with repeated letters. For example, if the target word has one 't' but the user guess contains multiple 't's, some logic might incorrectly classify extra 't's as misplaced rather than not in the word. The current code doesn't count letter occurrences precisely.
   - **Misplaced Letters Logic:**  
     The condition in `identifyMisplacedLetters()` checks if:
     - The letter is not in the well-placed letters array, or
     - `wordToGuess.split(letter).length - 1 > 1`  
       This approach seems a bit naive. It's trying to handle multiple occurrences but might not handle them accurately. A more robust approach would be to count occurrences of each letter in both words and then determine how many are well-placed, misplaced, or not present.

5. **Component Creation (creations.js):**

   - `createApp()` returns a template string of HTML that includes:
     - An input and button for submitting guesses.
     - Sections for displaying hints and results.
     - This code is injected into `#app` during initialization.

6. **Styling (CSS Files):**

   - The CSS structure uses multiple files and the `@import` directive:
     - `variables.css` defines color variables and font families.
     - `base.css` sets global styles for elements, including a global font, background, and color transitions.
     - `app.css` is currently empty, suggesting a space for more specific styling.

   The CSS uses `:root` variables with HSL values to create a monochromatic color scheme, adjusting lightness levels to generate different shades.

**Key Points and Observations:**

- **Modular Code Organization:**  
  The code is split into multiple modules, each handling a different aspect of the functionality (events, handlers, DOM manipulation, logic utilities, and component creation). This is generally good practice.

- **Simplicity in the Initial Setup:**  
  The code demonstrates a neat event lifecycle:

  1. Wait for DOM content.
  2. Set the UI layout.
  3. Attach button event listeners.
  4. On button click, run the guessing logic.

- **Enhancements to Consider:**

  - **More Robust Letter Checking:**  
    Consider implementing a more accurate algorithm for handling multiple occurrences of letters. For instance:

    - First pass: Identify well-placed letters and count them down in a frequency map.
    - Second pass: Identify which remaining letters in the guess appear in the target word but are not well placed, decrementing counts in the frequency map as you go.
    - Finally, any letters left that cannot be matched are not in the word.

  - **User Experience Improvements:**

    - Validate user input (e.g., ensure a certain length or that the user doesn't submit an empty string).
    - Provide feedback messages if the input is invalid.
    - Possibly add a limit to the number of guesses or other game mechanics (like a Wordle-like experience).

  - **Styling & Responsiveness:**

    - The CSS is minimal. Additional styling in `app.css` could enhance the user interface.
    - Improve layout, spacing, and readability for a better UX.

  - **Dynamic or Multiple Words:**
    - Currently, the word to guess is hardcoded as `"dictionnaire"`.
    - For a more dynamic application, consider passing this word from a server or generating it randomly from a word list.

**Conclusion:**

The provided code sets up a basic word-guessing game with a clear structure and modular architecture. While it functions at a basic level, the logic for identifying misplaced letters is simplistic and may not handle repeated letters accurately. Additionally, the user experience could be improved through validation, better feedback, and more refined styling. As it stands, this is a solid starting point that can be iterated upon for a more robust and polished game.
